    <div id="description">
      <p><strong>Rear Admiral Grace M. Hopper</strong> is one of the first programmers of the <strong>Harvard Mark 1</strong>
        computer, invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and helped develop the idea of
        programming languages independent of particular machines – which led to the development of <strong>COBOL</strong>.
        Which in turn led to another of her nicknames: <strong>Grand Old Lady of Software</strong>, <a href="https://books.google.am/books?id=JT0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA33&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false"
          target="_blank"> <strong> Grandma COBOL</strong></a>, an early High Level Programming Language still in use
        today.</p>

      <p>Hopper is even credited with popularizing the word “<strong>debugging</strong>” for fixing computer
        programming glitches, the idea of machine-independent programming languages.</p>

        <h3>She was called by some “Amazing Grace.”</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>December 9, 1906</strong> - Born in New York. Her mother enjoyed mathematics. Her father worked as
          an insurance broker and had a large book collection. As a child, she built odd things with her Struktiron kit
          of beams, nuts, and bolts, what today we call Erector sets or Legos. She also followed her grandfather, a
          surveyor for New York City, as he laid out new streets, often holding the pole needed to measure distances.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1913</strong> - She was curious about how her alarm clocked worked. But when she took it apart, she
          was unable to put it back together. She continued taking apart seven alarm clocks, to the displeasure of her
          mother, who limited her to taking apart just one.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1923-1928</strong> - She graduated Vassar College, Hopper indulged her mathematical interests, and
          also took courses in physics and engineering. Then she attended Yale.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1930</strong> - She received a master's degree in Yale and a doctorate in 1934. These were rare
          achievements, especially for a woman.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1931</strong> - Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar College. Vassar College hired her first
          as an instructor, then as a professor of mathematics in 1941.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1930-1945</strong> - She lived with her husband, Vincent Foster Hopper, whom she had married in
          1930. They were divorced in 1945 and had no children. She did not marry again, but chose to retain his
          surname.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1943</strong> - Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States
          Navy Reserve.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1944</strong> - 1944, and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard
          University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She started working with <strong>Howard Aiken</strong> on the
          Harvard Mark I computer.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1945</strong> - Grace Hopper was at Harvard University, while working on the Mark-II, she
          discovered a hardware failure caused by a trapped moth. She coined the now common term "bug" to refer to
          unexpected computer failures.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1949</strong> - Hopper became an employee of the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation as a senior
          mathematician and joined the team developing the UNIVAC I. She designed an improved compiler and was part of
          the team which developed Flow-Matic, the first English-language data processing compiler. She invented the
          language APT and verified the language COBOL. The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer
          to be on the market in 1950, and was more competitive at processing information than the Mark I.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1952</strong> - When Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would
          use entirely English words, she "was told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't
          understand English." Her idea was not accepted for 3 years, and she published her first paper on the subject,
          compilers, in 1952. Her compiler "translated mathematical notation into machine code. That was the beginning
          of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. She could say "Subtract income tax from pay" instead of
          trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in
          data processing."
        </li>
        <li><strong>1954</strong> - Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming, and her
          department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including MATH-MATIC and
          FLOW-MATIC.
        </li>
        </li>
        <li><strong>1957</strong> - Hopper developed FLOW-MATIC, the first commercial, data-processing compiler that
          allowed computers to be used for automated billing and payroll calculation. FLOW-MATIC became the foundation
          for Hopper's next development the computer language COmmon Business Oriented Language, or COBOL.</li>
        <li><strong>1959</strong> - Hopper developed COBOL. Whereas IBM's FORTRAN programming language used a highly
          condensed, mathematical code, COBOL used common English language words. COBOL was written for use on
          different computers and was intended to be independent of any one computer company. For her wide-reaching
          influence on COBOL's development, Hopper was deemed the "grandmother of COBOL."
        </li>
        <li><strong>1967-1977</strong> - Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the
          Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973. She developed
          validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire
          Navy.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1969</strong> - Hopper was the first computer science "Man of the Year".
        </li>
        <li><strong>1991</strong> - President George H. Bush awarded her the National Medal of Technology.
        </li>
        <li><strong>January 1 1992</strong> - She died a year later, in Arlington, Virginia. and was buried with
          military honors in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.
        </li>
